<h4 id="7-interest-based-advertising">7. Interest Based Advertising</h4>
<p>Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual&#39;s preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.</p>
<p>We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the Treks products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.</p>
<p>These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person&#39;s interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.</p>
<p>In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.</p>
<p>The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties&#39; platforms.</p>
<p>We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person&#39;s perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.</p>
<p>Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.</p>
<p>Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites: ; and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>. These features will opt a Visitor out of many – but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.</p>
<h4 id="8-third-party-cookies">8. Third Party Cookies</h4>
<p>Swedish law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual&#39;s online activities from their site or service. We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.</p>
<p>The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.</p>
<p>The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.</p>
<p>We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties.</p>

Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. Treks is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.</p>
<p>Because Treks does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Treks is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter &quot;GDPR&quot;)  and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Treks should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Treks does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Treks in connection with Treks&#39; provision of Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.</p>
<p>The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.</p>
<p>Treks is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors&#39; servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Treks responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.</p>
